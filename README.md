Zakir contribution to CS5100 GP

Holds notebook containing models for Logistic Regression and SVM. The UI is currently a work in progress, and should be done by the testing phase.
We decided to pivot to determing whether individuals would be able to be middle class in the United States (being able to live comfrotably in the US)
as we thought the data was better suited for such a metric. 

PEAS

Environment: The Web Page, which includes drop-down menus and boxes for users to input attributes such as age, education, and country of origin
Agent: Our model(s) on the web page

Input: The information the user provides through the menus/boxes
Sensors: The menus/boxes on the web page, which we will feed to our models for predictions

Actuator: The computer display of the user. We will communicate whether a user will be able to live comforably in the US if based on the information they
proided through a text display.
